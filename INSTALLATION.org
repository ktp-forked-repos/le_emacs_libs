* Avoid `git submodule update' and `git submodule sync'

The sync direction isn't what you want as package maintainer. 
* INSTALLATION
** call `git_update_dot_gitmodules' to make sure right URLs are encoded.
** `cp -R' to install submosule with all remotes, etc in place

** .git folder for submodules lives in ../../.git/modules/.emacs.d/le_emacs_libs/modules/
